# üõ†Ô∏è SystemVerilog Digital Design Modules

This repository contains a collection of basic digital design components implemented in **SystemVerilog**, along with their corresponding **testbenches**. Each module demonstrates a key concept in digital logic design and can serve as a valuable learning or teaching resource for students and engineers alike.

## üß™ Simulation and Testing

Each module comes with a separate testbench designed to:

- Simulate expected behavior.
- Verify functional correctness through waveform inspection.
- Demonstrate edge case handling (e.g., resets, overflows).

### ‚úÖ Example Simulation (using iverilog)
```bash
iverilog -g2012 -o counter_tb.vvp AsynchronousUpCounter4Bit.sv AsyncCounter_TestBench.sv
vvp counter_tb.vvp
